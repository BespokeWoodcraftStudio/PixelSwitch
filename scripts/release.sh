# Ensures version is synced across: project.yml MARKETING_VERSION, git tag, and commit.

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh <version>
#   ./scripts/release.sh patch|minor|major
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/release.sh 1.3.0
#   ./scripts/release.sh patch    # 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4
#   ./scripts/release.sh minor    # 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0
#   ./scripts/release.sh major    # 1.2.3 -> 2.0.0
